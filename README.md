It's bad. It's really really bad.

There is so much to clean up in this project, I would not even know where to begin.
Kinda the reason why it's already uploaded. No idea where and how to clean it up.

But this is the source code of my Slime Rancher Multiplayer mod.
It went through many iterations and each new one had stuff copy pasted.

It's a mess within a mess.
Oh god, forgive me.

But for real. Have fun digging through my unoptimized and undocumented code.
I never thought I actually gonna release this, yet here we are.
Would have dressed differently if I would have known.

Don't judge me tho. It still .... "works".
Just not as good as it could!
