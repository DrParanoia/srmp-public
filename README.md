Currently working on going through the code, adding notes and fixing some of the bugs in my free time. 
I adore this mod and wanted to help out however I could. 

Currently, slowly working my way through the known list of bugs as of 1488. (See below)

--version: 1488----
Last Known bugs:
- Exchange sometimes skips rewards if multiple players put items in at the same time
- Exchange chest disappears without rewards
- Plort collectors don't work properly sometimes (Playing effect but not pulling anything)
- Nutcracker doesn't spit out right amount, or spits out "babies"
- Slimes sometimes appear "angry" for other players
- Game stutters when placing/removing gadgets
- First time using the mod can apparently break a lot of things (falling through world, slimes not eating) - Restarting the game fixes it
- DLCs don't seem to be loaded correctly when leaving and joining
- DLC are not initialized on game start, making the "You need following DLCs:" message pop up (Can be fixed by loading the "Manage DLCs" menu and trying again)
- FIXED: Multiplayer window doesn't show up on resolutions < 1920x1080
- Gordos don't drop things sometimes
- Slimes sometimes dont produce plorts
- Drones get stuck in place sometimes
- Chat sometimes empty for remote players
- Upgrades sometimes does not get applied to All players

It's bad. It's really really bad.

There is so much to clean up in this project, I would not even know where to begin.
Kinda the reason why it's already uploaded. No idea where and how to clean it up.

But this is the source code of my Slime Rancher Multiplayer mod.
It went through many iterations and each new one had stuff copy pasted.

It's a mess within a mess.
Oh god, forgive me.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But for real. Have fun digging through my unoptimized and undocumented code.
I never thought I actually gonna release this, yet here we are.
Would have dressed differently if I would have known.

Don't judge me tho. It still .... "works".
Just not as good as it could!
